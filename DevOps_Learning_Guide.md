# DevOps Learning Journey

I embarked on a comprehensive DevOps course that provided a blend of theoretical knowledge and hands-on practical experience, laying a strong foundation in DevOps principles and practices. Here's an overview of the key topics I explored during this journey:

## üìö Git and GitHub
Although I had some prior experience with Git and GitHub, the course deepened my understanding, particularly with using Pull Requests in GitHub. I learned to execute Git commands via the terminal, which significantly enhanced my skills in version control, code reviews, and GitHub operations. I now have a solid grasp of core Git concepts, such as branching, merging, and rebasing, and I understand how version control integrates into the broader DevOps pipeline.

## üê≥ Docker and Kubernetes
Docker and Kubernetes were pivotal topics in the course. I discovered how Docker containers streamline application deployment by packaging applications and their dependencies in isolated environments. Additionally, I delved into Kubernetes, a robust orchestration tool for automating the deployment, scaling, and management of containerized applications. The course covered the architecture and theoretical underpinnings of Docker and Kubernetes, emphasizing the importance of Kubernetes documentation, which is exceptionally well-written and informative.

## ‚òÅÔ∏è AWS and Terraform
My learning journey also included extensive training on Amazon Web Services (AWS), a leading cloud platform. I gained hands-on experience with various AWS services, such as EC2 and EKS, which are crucial for cloud infrastructure management. The course focused on creating EC2 instances and deploying applications on EKS. Additionally, I was introduced to Terraform, a tool for Infrastructure as Code (IaC), which helps automate AWS processes.

## üîí Kyverno, Knative, and Istio (Service Mesh Architectures)
One of the advanced topics covered was Service Mesh Architecture, including tools like Kyverno, Knative, and Istio. I learned how these tools facilitate the management of microservices-based architectures, providing policies, traffic management, security, and observability. Kyverno serves as a policy engine for Kubernetes, Istio as a robust service mesh for microservices communication, and Knative simplifies the deployment of serverless applications.

## üìä Prometheus and Grafana
Prometheus and Grafana are essential monitoring tools that I explored during the course. Our instructor emphasized the importance of monitoring tools for any successful organization. These tools are critical industry skills, ready for immediate application.

## üè¢ Industry Knowledge and Acknowledgement
I would like to express my gratitude to my course instructor [Mr. Saim Safdar](https://www.linkedin.com/in/saim-safder/) for his dedication and effort in teaching this course. He introduced us to the CNCF Landscape, paving the way for learning cloud and DevOps technologies. Moreover, he shared invaluable industry insights and trends, both nationally and internationally, which enriched our understanding of the DevOps field and its practical applications in the job market.
