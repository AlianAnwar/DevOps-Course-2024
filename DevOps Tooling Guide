# üõ†Ô∏è DevOps Tooling Operations for Sample To-Do App

This document outlines the DevOps tooling operations that I have implemented in this project using Kyverno policies and a GitHub Actions CI/CD pipeline.

## 1. Applying Kyverno Policies

To ensure that Kubernetes resources are properly managed, I applied Kyverno policies to enforce resource requests and limits for all Pods in the project.

### Kyverno Policy for Resource Limits

This policy ensures that all Pods have resource requests and limits for CPU and memory, helping to maintain cluster stability and effective resource management.

**Policy YAML (`k8s/policies/resource-limits.yml`):**

```yaml
apiVersion: kyverno.io/v1
kind: ClusterPolicy
metadata:
  name: pod-resource-limits
spec:
  rules:
    - name: check-resource-limits
      match:
        resources:
          kinds:
            - Pod
      validate:
        message: "Pod should have resource requests and limits"
        pattern:
          spec:
            containers:
              - resources:
                  requests:
                    memory: "128Mi"
                    cpu: "100m"
                  limits:
                    memory: "256Mi"
                    cpu: "200m"
